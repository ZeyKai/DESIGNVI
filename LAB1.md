# **HALF_ADDER** 

### 1. I started by following the instructions on GitHub to set up GHDL and gtkwave
### 2. I then watched a youtube video and followed along to make a Half_Adder example posted below

## The code I used is shown below ⤵️

### 4 This code shows an example using two inputs ( a and b) and two outputs ( c and o) , these variables would be manipulated to give us different outputs given different inputs with the help of "xor" and "and".



# **D_FLIP_FLOP**

### 1. Again, I watched a youtube video where I followed along on how to construct the D FLIP FLOP code
### 2. There was a big difference in the memory space this took, as my computer would get very loud when I was creating the .vcd file at the end to be opened by gtkwave.
### 3. I believe this is the case because unlike the HAlf ADDER code which ended in 5 nano seconds, this code ended in a unreal 8543723 nano seconds. I have provided picture below. (Note: The command prompt code does not show the analyzing and solution because my computer would freeze up after doing that, causing me to close the command prompt and reopen it to actually run the gtkwave code, which is why that is the only code you can see in the command prompt) ⤵️

### 4. In the future I may take this code down and redo it trying to use a smaller scale so the results can come out within 100 nano seconds which I believe would make them easier to understand and analyze. 

# **D_FLIP_FLIP_UPDATE**

## I have come to see that we were able to just use the code given under the Professor's GitHub page, I am upset to have found it after having doing everything from scratch with just the internet for an hour, but I am glad to have gotten some experience on it. Below is the screenshot for the D-FLIP_FLOP with the code provided ⤵️

## NOTE: It is refreshing to see the code stop at 210 nanoseconds and compared to my previous D FLIP FLOP example, it is easy to analyze
